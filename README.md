Code samples of cryptographic algorithms : Caesar, Vigenere and substitution.

"**break**" programs uses cryptanalysis to break encrypted messages. 

"**encrypt**" programs encrypt messages with a given key.

"**decrypt**" programs decrypt messages with a given key.

### Note on break programs

These programs have been created with the __*french*__ language in mind, it will not, or give weird results in other langages.

## Build

Build all programs using the `make` command.

## Launch

Each programs can be launched separately.

"**break**" programs takes a path to a text in argument. The result will be print in the terminal.

"**encrypt**" programs takes the encryption-key in argument. Then you can type the unencrypted text in terminal, the encrypted result will be stored in a txt file.

"**decrypt**" programs takes the decryption-key in argument. Then you can type the encrypted text in the terminal, the decrypted result will be stored in a txt file.
